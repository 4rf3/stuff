# Stuff
Some of the stuff I've been coding in the recent years

## [Neigbor counter](https://github.com/ar-fe/stuff/tree/main/neighbour_counter)
A program I wrote to test a hypothesis concerning the structure of porous aluminium oxide. Its structure comprises hexagonal domains (in which every pore has 6 neighbours) along with unstructured regions, and the question was how many hexagonally and non-hexagonally coordinated neighbours a 6-coordinated pore has (and the same question for non-6 pores). Input data is coordinates of pore centers, obtained from a transmission electron microscopy image.

## [Sublattice model](https://github.com/ar-fe/stuff/tree/main/sublattice_model)
This was for my bachelor's diploma. A sublattice model is a thermodynamic model (a thermodynamic model is a general formula for calculation of a phase's free energy, which allows to calculate, besides a number of thermodynamic parameters, which phase is the most stable at certain composition, temperature and pressure). The formula for a sublattice model is based on the chemical formula of a compound, and in this project I implemented a Matlab class which converts a chemical formula into a free energy expression using symbolic algebra.

## [Printing books](https://ar-fe.github.io/pages-calc/)
This is an algorithm which allows to print small (in terms of page dimensions, from A5 to A7) books using a regular A4 printer. It returns a sequence of pages for two-sided printing with multiple pages on sheet.

## [Inserting possible restriction sites](https://github.com/ar-fe/stuff/tree/main/restriction_sites)
In molecular biology, it is sometimes necessary to modify a coding sequence of a protein to include a restriction enzyme site without changing the protein sequence â€“ this is possible due to degeneracy of the genetic code. Manual search for potential sites would be tedious, and this module automatizes the search for an arbitrary number of restictrion enzymes.
